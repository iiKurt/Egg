TODOs:

More important:
- Use letterboxing and logical sizes (or just detect window size on resize) to make 1 pixel equal 3, 4, 5 etc when the window size is big enough
- Tune difficulty timings
	- Perhaps have a mode where it cycles through numbers, rather than it being random?
- Version parity with watch edition, easter egg text color, some strings, acknowledgement counter, timing
	- and with Classic SDL version, green text when completed etc
- Android
	- Display copyright information and website link somewhere (https://gist.github.com/tzmartin/61ca361070409fdb8153, https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/components/settings#java)?
	- Doesn't seem to render unless touch event occurs?
	- Move version information away from /AndroidStudio to /Bundled
	- Icons too small on homescreen
	- Can't easily update the android version when SDL updates... have to re-copy Java files from sample android SDL project
- Crashes or anything? to do with events and race conditions?
- Redo icons with x3 scalings

Meh:
- GitHub actions! Use artifacts as files for releases
- Incorporate EggMac somewhere into the program
- Have things such as copyright stored in a generic info file that can be added to info.plist or exe properties, rather than maintaining different info files
- Other TODOs in the code
- Sync up BMPF with repo
- Figure out what can/should be written in C vs C++
